## Introduction

Nebulae Communitas is the framework for "cloud communities", people connected to each other.

The three main focuses for this connection are the following:
  * Church
  * Home
  * School

These documents should contain all the necessary information to set up a church, school, or home. I am pleased to consider this project open-source, which means that all this knowledge is free to use.

The Core is where the knowledge is held. The different implementations (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) draw on the Core, but modifying it for different cultures, locations, and resources.

## History

February 6, 2013 started an idea in my mind, the connecting between Church, Home, and School. Over the following months that idea grew.

This was first carrried out by a wiki I created to work though these ideas. As the idea continued to grow in my mind, I realized that a propetary online wiki was not sufficent for the further development of this project. On October 21, 2013, it was decided I would move this project to Github, to further the devleopment there.

## Status

NebCom is not operational:
  * Constitutions are still in need of polish and revision
  * Curriculum needs be to draw up for Planet School
  * Core needs to be finished
  * Almost no work has been done on the practical implementations

This documents fundamental beliefs that led the the inclusion of practices. If you have a problem with a practice, the solution is not to first dismiss the practice, but to understand the belief below that practice. If you disagree with the practice, but agree with the belief, then you are in good company. It does not matter if you change the practice, if the belief is upheld.

All of our pracices, all of our interactions, can only be properly understood when we understand who God is.

#God
+ Omniscient
+ Omnipresent
+ Omnipotent
+ Immortal
+ Relational
+ Holy
+ Father, Son, Holy Spirit
+ Life

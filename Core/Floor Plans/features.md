##Church

* Church has 3 sections
    * Each section focused on the centre (which is a cross)
    * seeing beyond the cross will look toward the doors (symbolizing our outward focus on the world
    * Lighting comes down from above, where there will be the colour spretrum of coloured glass, to remind us of the promises of God as we look towards Him, the source of our light
    * The centre location is built accoustically well, so instruments are used, but no electricity is used. This place is used for group teaching, and singing
    * The different church's meet in the 12 rooms surrounding the centre location. It is here that teaching is done, sharing and community can take place.
    * the dining room off to the side is where the breaking of bread happens (communion)
    * Possible to have 24 church's present

{"name":"Nebulaecommunitas","tagline":"Building Cloud Communities","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nNebulae Communitas is the framework for “cloud communities”, people connected to each other.\r\nThe three main focuses for this connection are the following:\r\n\r\n* Church\r\n* School\r\n* Home\r\n\r\nAll built on a common\r\n* Foundation\r\n\r\nThese documents should contain all the necessary information to set up a church, school, or home. I am pleased to consider this project open-source, which means that all this knowledge is free to use.\r\n\r\n\r\n# February 6, 2013\r\n\r\nAn idea started in my mind, connecting Church, Home, and School. Over the following months that idea grew.\r\n\r\nThis was first carrried out by a wiki I created to work though these ideas. As the idea continued to grow in my mind, I realized that a proprietary online wiki was not sufficent for the further development of this project. On October 21, 2013, it was decided I would move this project to Github, to further the devleopment there.\r\n\r\n#Status\r\n\r\nNebCom is not operational:\r\nConstitutions are still in need of polish and revision\r\nCurriculum needs be to draw up for Planet School\r\nCore needs to be finished\r\nAlmost no work has been done on the practical implementations\r\n\r\n# Liscense\r\nAll content is under a GPL v3 liscense\r\n\r\n# Contact\r\n\r\nMy Name is David Guenther, and you can find more about me here http://about.me/daguenther\r\n\r\n# To Contribute\r\nDownload and recompile\r\n\r\nI use Texmaker, which relies on LaTex technology. Final drafts will be exported to PDF.\r\n\r\n# Git\r\n\r\nIf you wish to work with me on this, you will first need to understand how Git works http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1\r\nIf the command line scares you, then you can download a GUI http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis\r\nYou will need to create an account with Github to work on it. Please fork the project, and we can collaborate from there on things to include.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}

<p>Nebulae Communitas is the framework for “cloud communities”, people connected to each other.
The three main focuses for this connection are the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Church</li>
<li>School</li>
<li>Home</li>
</ul><p>All built on a common</p>

<ul>
<li>Foundation</li>
</ul><p>These documents should contain all the necessary information to set up a church, school, or home. I am pleased to consider this project open-source, which means that all this knowledge is free to use.</p>

<p>An idea started in my mind, connecting Church, Home, and School. Over the following months that idea grew.</p>

<p>This was first carrried out by a wiki I created to work though these ideas. As the idea continued to grow in my mind, I realized that a proprietary online wiki was not sufficent for the further development of this project. On October 21, 2013, it was decided I would move this project to Github, to further the devleopment there.</p>

<a name="status" class="anchor" href="#status"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Status</h1>

<p>NebCom is not operational:
Constitutions are still in need of polish and revision
Curriculum needs be to draw up for Planet School
Core needs to be finished
Almost no work has been done on the practical implementations</p>

<p>If you wish to work with me on this, you will first need to understand how Git works <a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1">http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1</a>
If the command line scares you, then you can download a GUI <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis">http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis</a>
You will need to create an account with Github to work on it. Please fork the project, and we can collaborate from there on things to include.</p>

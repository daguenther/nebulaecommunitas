<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>
Nebulae Communitas is the framework for “cloud communities”, people connected to each other.<br>
</p>

<p>
The three main focuses for this connection are the following:<br>
</p>

<p>
<a href="./Church.html" title="Church" class="page">Church</a><br>
<a href="./School.html" title="School" class="page">School</a><br>
<a href="./Home.html" title="Home" class="page">Home</a><br>
</p>

<p>
These documents should contain all the necessary information to set up a church, school, or home. I am pleased to consider this project open-source, which means that all this knowledge is free to use.<br>
</p>

<p>
The Core is where the knowledge is held. The different implementations (Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta) draw on the Core, but modifying it for different cultures, locations, and resources.<br>
</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>
February 6, 2013 started an idea in my mind, the connecting between Church, Home, and School. Over the following months that idea grew.<br>
</p>

<p>
This was first carrried out by a wiki I created to work though these ideas. As the idea continued to grow in my mind, I realized that a proprietary online wiki was not sufficent for the further development of this project. On October 21, 2013, it was decided I would move this project to Github, to further the devleopment there.<br>
</p>

<h2>Status</h2>

<p>
NebCom is not operational:<br>
</p>

<p>
Constitutions are still in need of polish and revision<br>
Curriculum needs be to draw up for Planet School<br>
Core needs to be finished<br>
Almost no work has been done on the practical implementations<br>
</p>

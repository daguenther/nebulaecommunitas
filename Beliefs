This documents fundamental beliefs that led the the inclusion of
practices. If you have a problem with a practice, the solution is not to
first dismiss the practice, but to understand the belief below that
practice. If you disagree with the practice, but agree with the belief,
then you are in good company. It does not matter if you change the
practice, if the belief is upheld.

All of our practices, all of our interactions, can only be properly
understood when we understand who God is.

each other. The way we interact with God is the same way we should
interact with each other, and with knowledge.

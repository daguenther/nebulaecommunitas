## (F.1.0) Core Beliefs

This documents fundamental beliefs that led the the inclusion of best
practices. All of our practices, all of our interactions, can only be properly
understood when we understand who God is.

Not all cultures and people will implement these truths in exactly the same way.
It is crucial to understand that while this document will provide theory and practice, it is not a fix all solution, and must be applied to various contexts and peoples.

### (F.1.1) God

When we fully understand who God is, it changes the way we approach all learning. God is:

1.  Omniscient (all knowing)

2.  Omnipresent (all present)

3.  Omnipotent (all powerful)

4.  Eternal

5.  Relational

6.  Trinity

7.  Holy

8.  Life

9.  Love

These lists and ideas come from an understanding of the God
portrayed in both the pre-Christ, Christ, and post-Christ Testament
(also known as the Old Testament, the Gospels, and the New Testament

The interaction between people and knowledge need not be divorced from
each other. The way we interact with God is the same way we should
interact with each other, and with knowledge.

Our relationship to God is the most fundamental relationship.
It is through that relationship that all other relationships flow.


### (F.1.2) Knowledge Sphere

1.  Knowledge requires exploration

2.  Knowledge requires real examples

3.  Knowledge requires giving of ourselves

4.  Knowledge requires commitment to learn

5.  Knowledge requires communication

6.  Knowledge requires submission to truth

7.  Knowledge requires errors and correction

8.  Knowledge requires application to life

9.  Knowledge requires love (we must love knowledge enough to apply it to our lives)

### (F.1.3) Social Sphere

1.  Relationship requires exploration

2.  Relationship requires physical interaction

3.  Relationship requires giving of ourselves

4.  Relationship requires commitment

5.  Relationship requires communication

6.  Relationship requires submission to each other

7.  Relationship requires change and repentance

8.  Relationship requires living life together

9.  Relationship requires love (we must love others enough to put them above ourselves)

## (F.2.0) Social Organization

Each individual is composed of knowledge, built on the core of God
(Father, Son, Holy Spirit).

In the church, we function as a community founded on the knowledge of
God. As God is our Creator, and the foundation of all knowledge, the
church unit is the more fundamental organization in society. When the
Church fails, society as a whole fails.

Families form the emotional and physical relationship needed for kids.
Schools (primarily) form the intellectual relationships needed.

Each division adheres to the community approach, in which larger groups
of individuals are always composed of smaller groups.

### (F.2.1) Tier 1

1 leader with a small group.

I have labored long and hard to try and find some mathematical
formula to find the group size through the number *e*, but I have
not been successful. Needless to say that this group size will not
be determined. It is up to the group and the culture to establish
what an acceptable group size is for Tier 1. Essentially the gist of
it all is that this is the smallest group, and as such, everyone in
the group should know everyone else quite well. I think a number
like 12 individuals is the maximum for such a group size, but perhaps in some
cultures that is not the case. The most intimate discipleship and
fellowship happens in this group.

### (F.2.2) Tier 2

Multiple leaders with a larger group.

The general idea of this group is a group consisting of a number
of Tier 1 groups. It is a collection of people all coming together
in community. In the context of a church this is the sunday morning
worship. In a school, something similar to a class grade. In the
Home, this would consist of the extended family. It is not assumed
that one leader will rule over the others in such a scenario. Each
unit that composes the Tier 2 is self-sustaining, and should not
need to be governed from a central position. It is the community
that works within itself to mold and build. This growth does not
come from a top down power triangle, but rather a leader who
empowers others to help others. However, it is expected that leaders
will work together in matters.


### (F.2.3) Tier 3

Many leaders with groups of Tier 2

The point of such a group is to bring unity to an otherwise
self-sustaining group. Announcements can be given, and socializing to
connect people who may not otherwise know about each other.

### (F.2.4) Diagram

![image](8-social community.png) Merely my attempt at a mathematical
model of group size. As is, it is an example of how groups are built up
of smaller groups.

## (F.3.0) Modular Policies

These are built upon the previous core beliefs

### (F.3.1) Abortion

Any child in need of a home will be adopted, if it will save their life
from being aborted. Steps will be taken to ensure that the baby is not
killed by the mother

### (F.3.2) Face2Face

The most effective way to produce change in another person is through
the use of face to face conversation

### (F.3.3) Open Hearts

Our hearts are open to those who cry out for help. They will not be
turned away open-handed. Either with physical, emotional, intellectual,
or spiritual help. As far as we have means, we help others. There is no
child who is beyond our help. There is no difficulty we are not willing
to tackled.

### (F.3.4) Profit

Religion, Knowledge, and Relationships must always be given without pay. Relationships must be build
with no pretext of monetary gain. To this end, all three structures are
strictly non-profit, and should maintain that status. In the case of those who work within different spheres, they should receive wages for their work, but this money should come from the community who supports them, not from outsiders.

### (F.3.5) Homosexuality

The CSH Foundation recognizes that those who struggle with homosexuality
believe that they will find peace in expressing what they feel inside.
The CSH Foundation also recognizes that one’s identity and worth are not
found in what someone feels about themselves, but in their relationship
to God. As such, students who feel attracted to the same sex are
encouraged to come to all spheres, but they do so under the
understanding that the community is there to help them find their
identity in Christ.

We were created male and female. While Galatians 3:28 speaks of
our belonging in Christ, it does not speak to destroying all roles.
Paul was not advocating freedom for every slave, but rather to work
in their role. Homosexuality is a hard road to follow, but we
believe that true peace, and true joy, and true love, are found in
the will of God alone. More could be argued against homosexuality
from an scientific, sociological, or logical standpoint, but that is
left as an exercise for the reader.

### (F.3.6) Women in Leadership

Women are not permitted to teach or have authority over men, in any
sphere.

This is not to say that the any sphere can exist without women. It
cannot. The home cannot exist with women, schools cannot exist very
well without women, and churches desperately need more females to
help. This is not meant to destroy the ministry of women, but rather
to channel it. Teach means more then just to spout knowledge, but
rather to have a relationship where they are actively guiding
another individual.

### (F.3.7) Adulthood

Children transition into adults when they reach puberty. It is at this age that they are held responsible for their actions by the greater community. It is at this age that they are capable of marrying and contributing to the greater community in various regards.

### (F.3.8) Leadership

Plurality of leadership is a must for any organization.

This applies to Tier 2 situations, as Tier 1 situations are usually 1 or 2 instructors.

can use it (Policies:0PK Policy)

Some are more capable with technology, and will serve to make the system
run simply for others

#### Software to use

*If a open source alternative with similar abilities exist, it will be
used*

-   [StackEdit](https://stackedit.io/) for Markdown collaboration

-   Any Latex Editor

-   [Ubuntu](http://www.ubuntu.com/) for servers, tablets, phones,
    desktops, laptops, and tv’s

-   Any code editor

-   [QT creator](http://qt-project.org/) for app design

-   [Gimp](http://www.gimp.org/) for image editing

    quite well, but [Docuwiki](https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki) is
    another amazing application

-   [GitLab](https://www.gitlab.com/) for collaboration on documents

## Integration

### Internally

Each organization has a resonsiblity to work together, to build a
relationship with themselves. They are an autonomous organization, as as
such, can ignore the foundation that they are started upon. This is
merely to framework to guide for those who are searching for light. It
is not, and is not, the end in itself. It is a set of tools to help. As
such, Each Tier (1,2, and 3) is responsible for:

-   Use of resources

-   Facilities

-   Starting new Tiers

Each Tier is designed to work with others. There is no rule, no law that
can cause people to willingly work together. It must be, and always will
be, people who will make this work. Each Tier must be autonomous, and
willfully connect and collaborate with others.

### Externally

Each Tier 3 seeks to work with other Tier 3 groups in the local area, to
build a relationship with others. As each section is already intimately
connected with each other by means of living life, this should not be
overly difficult.

## Expansion

When a Tier reaches too large of a size, it must consider starting a new
tier. This process consists of individuals (or Tiers) within the current
tier being sent out to start a new one, with the help of others from the
same Tier. It is not a contest nor a battle to have the largest Tier,
but rather to grow the kingdom of God. This process always consists of
dividing into 2 parts.

[^10]: this ensures that a document can be opened many many years into
    the future

[^11]: This does not mean that services outside of a local server cannot
    be used. This is just a recognition that a teacher should not depend
    on the Internet for the success of a lesson

[^12]: This is not to say any of these technologies are the pinacle of
    usability, or that in years to come they should be used. Essentially
    this list represents a single theme: use open software that is free
    to use, and not locked in to propietary based software. It is
    expected that better software will emerge under an open liscense,
    and those new developments should be used

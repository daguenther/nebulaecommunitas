# Primary

Primary school should be done by the parents. With help from the school, the church, and the home, parents are given information to help them with the development of their child.

If students are not able to take care of their children due to financial circumstances, the School, the Home, and the Church will help with pairing young parents with those who can help. In connection with their Fellowship, other families could step up to help in the development of the child.

Students from infancy up to age 14 are within this level.

# Secondary Class Sizes (Level 1, 2, and 3)

The ideal for secondary and tetriatary levles is 12 students per teacher. (12:1)

Each level should take one year to complete, but variation may occur to meet the needs of various students.

# Tetriatary

Students will learn the skills necessary for their focus of career. This is levels 4, 5, 6, and 7.

# Instructional Time

A student should take no more then 3 classes at a time, with 3 meeting times per class per week. This provides the teacher with more time to create great lessons, and also provides students time to work on assignments, as well as receive further help if the need arises. Each class should take 3 weeks to complete.

The rest of the time is spent in self study and student organized learning.

# School Size

A school will consist of 12 classes running at the same time per level (or 144 students per level).

Combined with a 3 secondary levels, the school size for secondary should be around 432 students.

A total school size should consist of 1000 or so students

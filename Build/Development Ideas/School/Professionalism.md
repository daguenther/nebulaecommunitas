# Professionalism

Teachers want to be considered professionals, but in order for that to happen we need to be self regulated. However, the problem arises because most of the teachers entering in the profession are not in a place to self regulate themselves. The educational requirements to become a teacher are significantly less then lawyers and doctors. In that sense, we are faced with an impossibility. However, I do have a tentative solution.

First, we need experienced teachers. These are teachers who have spent time in both theory and practice, and who are considered masters at their craft. These experienced teachers are the backbone of instructing the next generation.

I see a network of experienced teachers teaching the next generation of teachers. It is not so much as going into a program and developing a cookie cut degree, but developing a relationship with an experienced teacher and maintaining that for a longer period of time. Due to the changing nature of people, there must be an accepted standard that all teachers must adhere to: and it is to teach students.

To be a teacher means to teach students.

If a teacher does not properly educate students, they cannot be considered a teacher.

As I reflect on my University career, I find that most of the theory was useless, because it was not grounded in community, but rather in an idea arising from individual the university had deemed good teachers. I would argue that the best teachers are still teaching students. In fact, teachers who are no longer teaching students forgot the practice, and emphasize the theory.

At NEBCOM, a teacher education program is in place. This comes from two significant and equal part components. Each semester is broken down into the thoery, and then the practice. This continues for 6 semesters, for a total of 3 semesters in theory, and 3 in practice. The student studies under a particular teacher, who they learn to teach from. Their job is to study this master teacher, and learn from them.

These master teachers should be teaching less classes (although they still need to teach). Their focus is to supervise and instruct new teachers for their first 3 years. This diminishes the burn out rate, and also provides the support needed to become a master teacher themselves.

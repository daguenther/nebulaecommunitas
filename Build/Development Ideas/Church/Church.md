# Propogation

The process of new church creation is separated into multiple steps.
Step 1 is for an existing Tri-Congregation Church (TCC) to create a new church

Step 2 is to expand until the church is duo congregation.

Step 3 is to become a TCC and and be established well

Step 4 is to create a new church.

* Until a new church is considered stable (and has the blessing of the mother church), it continues to function under the authority of the other church. This relationship ideally should between 3 and 10 years.

All other organizations function by various church's working together to support the ministry. At no point should an organization work independently of any local church. The local churches should always be the council that drives any ministry forward. This ensures that the framework that God himself instituted is unitized to its highest capacity and function. For our God is not a God of trivial design. He is a God of creativity and inginuity.

# Organization

Each church consists of smaller groups of people coming together.

At the basic level is the Fellowship

## Fellowship

The Fellowship consists of no more then 7 families or 14 individuals (excluding children), one of which is their elder. They purpose to meet together once a week or more.


Functions include:

* eating meals together
* Communion
* praying for one another
* Reading portions of Scripture and meditating on it (systematically to develop a whole view of the Bible) - Read the Bible in a year
* Singing songs
* Encouraging each other
* Giving new members a place to belong
* Encouraging existing members to prepare Bible studies to push them to leadership and Christian Service

## Procedure

1. Prayer
2. Song (chosen by Fellowship)
3. Reading (from existing plan)
4. Song
5. Reading
6. Song
7. Teaching
8. Song
9. Sharing
10. Prayer

## Assembly

The Assembly consists of no more then 12 Fellowships (12 elders). They purpose to meet together once every two weeks.

Functions include:

* Public teaching of the Word
* Public Worship (worship nights?)
* Public Communion
* Public Prayer
* Baptism
* Weddings
* Prophecy
* Tongues and Interpretation
* Public announcements

## Church

The Church consists of 3 assemblies (36 elders). They purpose to meet together once every month.

Functions include:

* Public Teaching of the Word
* Public Communion
* Ministry updates from surrounding para-church ministries.
* Finance updates for the church
* Direction and Mission of the church

# Elders

An elder has the following requirements

* Above repoach
* Has one wife (and an assumed male)
* Temperate
* Self Controlled
* Respectable
* Hospitable
* An able Teacher
* Not a drunkard
* Not violent
* Gentle
* Not contentious
* Does not love money
* Keep his children in control without losing dignity
* Not a recent convert
* Well thought of by those outside the faith (while not compromising truth)

An elder is not the CEO, or the master, or the supervisor of the church. They are the shepherd of people, caring for their souls. As such, they are not to be seen as one who stands up at the front and leads the battle charge, but the man who stands in the back and keeps the sheep on the right path. Many elders make sure that all the sheep are taken care of. A plurality of elders means that when council is taken as to the direction of the church, many ideas can be brought forth and weighed.

Such a number of elders may not be possible in all circumstances. However, a greater number of elders give means for greater amounts of discipleship and training. Not all elders need be public teachers, but all must be able to teach their Fellowship.

# Bible Reading

Each year the Fellowship decides to read the Bible in a year. It is their choice on the Bible Reading plan. On the day set aside for meeting, the group shares anything from the pervious week that stood out to them. This allows for consistent reading through the Bible, while giving freedom to individuals to speak on their choice. Naturally a Godly leader should not pick and choose passages to read, but hopefully in a context of community different people will pick up on different things.

Families are encouraged to read half of the Bible readings as a family, and the rest individually.

# Marriage

In an increasing age where marriage is viewed as a relic of something prior, marriage must not only be tolerated, but encouraged.

Young people seeking to get married can bring this before their Parents. Their parents in turn will seek a spouse, and set up a date.

After a first date the couple can decide if this is something they want to continue.

Through connection with homes, simple housing should be provided for young couples. Education can continue, as the community continues to help with financial and social responsibilities.

## Procedures

When a man reaches puberty he may request a wife. A woman also may request a husband when she reaches puberty. The parents will seek out a mate, and once an agreement has been made by all parties (both sets of parents, and both the man and woman), the marriage will happen.

This ceremony will happen in the church, and will not be elaborate beyond what the parents can provide.

Housing will be provided for the new couple (preferably with the parents). For the first 3 years of their marriage they will be provided with help, in the form of physical needs and emotional guidance in this transitional time. This enables newlyweds to remain at school and complete their education if they desire to do so.

Just a thought: after 3 years the newlyweds take a month to spend time with each other (late honeymoon).

The family's responsibility is to make a good choice, and provide the framework through example and speaking that marriage is a lifetime commitment. A marriage should take place only if both parties acknowledge the significance of their decision, and are prepared to live with it for the rest of their life. Young men and women should also understand that marriage is about learning to love the other person, and not finding the perfect person.

This can only work if the previous things are met, namely:

* understand that marriage is permanent so long as both people are alive
* It is the responsibility of the families to help find a spouse, and provide for the first years

(this is of course abiding to country laws. As this is a non-essential, the governing country will be obeyed first in this matter)

## Side Note

It is the failure of the relationship between of husband and wife that many of our current problems arise. If men and women both felt sexually complete in marriage, and were in a loving relationship, then sex trafficking would dissappear overnight. If no one bought into the lie, then it would fade. Likewise porn would be elimated. Mastubation would be gone. This is not an absolute, evil will continue to fight til the day it dies, but providing a way to cut it off at its roots is healthy.

I didn't seem to see this before, but as I pondered, it became clear. We are beings designed for an intimate relationship. We are beings designed to become adults as puberty begins. The problem is that we don't consider teenagers adults. We assume they do not have the mental capabilities to make decisions that they will have to live with for the rest of their life. So we downplay their maturity and create teenagers. The teenager population are a bunch of adults who have been told they are not adults, and yet are capable of being so. They are not given maturity, so they create their own subculture. This is inherently disaterious for the larger population, as the immaturity of teenagers is now being felt in all reaches of society. This is not because the adults are not capable of making mature decisions, but rather that they are note expected to. Expect them to, and they will. Let them make mistakes, for then they will learn.

Speaking from the perspective of a man: when my body hit puberty I discovered I had reproductive organs I wanted to use. However, I had no legitimate way of releasing this tension. So I am forced to hide it, to repress it. To fight it tooth and nail so that I can remain pure. Now this fight does sift the very strong from the weak, but that is not the nature of the Christian faith. It is the Devil who wants to sift us like wheat, is Love that offers grace and strength to weak. God has designed our bodies for sexual intimacy, so it would be wise that when the body desires sexual intimacy, to think very carefully about pursuing that means. 

Had I been married when I was 14, I would be pursuing a physical intimacy with a woman, instead of sitting in my bathroom and playing with my penis. I think it not hard to comprehend which of the two is the healthier option. For this constant repressing has created a culture within myself of autoeroticism. I fight it daily, but it is because this beast has been here for 10 years. And as our society seems to be increasingly saturated with sex, young men and women should have someone who they can run to away from the sexual corruption of our world. I would be an immature husband, and would make many mistakes. But I think that if both me and my wife knew that marriage was forever, and would be willing to work it out, I would be more mature today. For I would be forced to live and respect another individual (which destroys our culture of individuality).

On all accounts, I think this is the best method forward. It does requirea  culture shift of how we view marriage and beccoming of age, and I wonder if when the time comes, I will let my daughters and sons marry when they reach puberty.

						<h1>Curriculum</h1>
		</div>
			<li>The Core (the fundamental truth that lies within)</li>
<li>The History of how that truth was practised and interpreted</li>
<li>The current application of that knowledge, building on the history and the truth, to create: culture.</li>
<br>
All students first learn the culture of knowledge, the accepted norms and procedures asssociated with each piece of knowledge they aquire. Students enging in higher levels of study will review the previous knowledge they gained, understanding the history, and then the truth of the knowledge.<br>
<br>
<h2>Core</h2><br>
At the core of every indivudual is their relationship to God. To begin all development of intellectual, emotional, physical, and spiritual growth, the individual must have an understanding of God and their relationship to Him (Father, Son, Holy Spirit). It is primarily taught in the homeschool phase, and then built upon in the high school phase.<br>
<br>
<h2>Lower Mantle </h2>

<h3>Homeschool</h3><br>
<br>
School does accept students as young as 5, but this is not encouraged. the school provides support materials for parents seeking to homeschool their children. The reccommended age to stop home schooling is 12. For children under the age of 12 they will be assigned to one teacher until they reach high school. This teacher will have 12 students under them. The idea is to provide a concrete learning base similar to children in home school situations. It would be great if a local parents under approval from the church agrees to do this. They do not need a degree to do this, and will be paid the expected wage. Children will be taught from a Christian Worldview.<br>
<br>
<h3> High School</h3><br>
<br>
I think the best way to implement this is to have a leves based approach. In which you can only progress to the next level of music once you have completed a previous level in math. In this way all the subjects and both the hemispheres (logic and creativity) are intertwined with each other. As there will be a limited amount of teachers accepting students for a particular class, students may take a higher level class (so long as they have met the requirements). When a lower level class opens up, they then proceed to take that.<br>
<br>
Teachers are assigned 12 students to teach for 3 weeks. They will teach them everything they need to know on a particular topic. Teacher may differ on how to approach this:<br>
<li>some may have a class, and then a work period, a class, and then anouther work period.</li>
<li>some may have all the classes first in a day, and then work periods until the students go home.</li>
<br>
Classes are split into 3 week blocks.<br>
<br>
<h4>Logic - Math / Science</h4>
<li>Learning to think linearly</li>
<li>Problems and Solutions</li>
<li>Observations, Analysis, and Predictions</li>
<li>The study of the physical world and how it works</li>

<h4>Creativity - Language / Communication</h4>
<li>Learning to think Abstractly</li>
<li>Reorganizing</li>
<li>The process of taking an existing item and transforming it into something new</li>
<li>The process of reading and writing according to standard rules</li>
<li>Speaking with clarity</li>

<h3>Upper Mantle</h3><br>
This should theoretically be every occupation that a student might pursue<br>
The school will work in conjuction with other local businesses, to provide internships as much as possible<br>
Some careers, however, will need to continue into higher education<br>
<br>
<h4>Engineering</h4>
<li>Computer</li>
<li>Physical</li>
<li>Chemical</li>

<h4>Scientist</h4>
<li>Math</li>
<li>Biology</li>
<li>Chemistry</li>
<li>Physics</li>

<h4>Theology (working with the local Church)</h4>
<li>Pastoring</li>
<li>Church History</li>
<li>Greek</li>
<li>Hebrew</li>
<li>Evangelism</li>
<li>Interpreting the Bible</li>
<li>Preaching</li>

<h4>Linguistics</h4>
<li>Foreign Languages</li>
<li>Foreign Cultures</li>

<h2>Others</h2>
<li>Artists</li>
<li>Business</li>
<li>Social Services</li>
<li>Educators</li>
<br>
The above should learn via an extended internship<br>

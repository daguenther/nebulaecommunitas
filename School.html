Created Thursday 30 January 2014<br>
</p>


<h2>Purpose</h2>
<p>
The School Community exists to educate students intellectually. To educate students well mentally requires spiritual education, emotional education, and physical education. Planet School will serve as the primary component of a students intellectual education, while allowing various other entities to contribute to a childâ€™s full development.<br>
</p>

<p>
Planet School purpose is the transfer of knowledge centered around God, creating students who are physically fit, mentally sound, and spiritually alive.<br>
</p>

<h2>Organization</h2>

<h3>Teachers</h3>

<p>
Teachers have a relationship with a specific knowledge; their role is to help foster a relationship between the student and this knowledge. To accomplish this, teachers must have a relationship with the students. Teachers are administrators, in the sense that collectively they work together to keep the school running well. The head teacher, considered First Among Equals makes sure the operation of the school is smooth.<br>
</p>

<h3>Students</h3>

<p>
Students goal is to build a relationship with knowledge. The most effective way for students to do this is to build a relationship with a teacher. Other forms include learning from a teacher without relationship, and investigating the knowledge without a teacher, but neither of these two systems are as effective as the first. As students gain knowledge, they are then capable of imparting that knowledge to other students<br>
</p>

<h2>Development</h2>

<h3>Primary Development</h3>

<p>
This stage is from age 0 to 12. This focuses on the core curriculum aspects. This stage is taught with close connection with the parents. The school provides curriculum, events, and peer to peer relationships in a home school environment. Parents are encouraged to educate their children until until 12, at which point they will continue their education at the school. For broken families, or families where this is not possible, the school provides education for these children, bringing in parents belong to a church. In such a case, students will be educated about the foundations of Christianity.<br>
</p>

<h3>Secondary Development</h3>

<p>
This stage is from 12-18, and continues the development started in the Primary stage. Students at the end of this will have the skills required to learn any job.<br>
</p>

<h3>Tertiary Development</h3>

<p>
This stage is from 18-24, and is the last level in the development. Students will learn specific career skills, and/or participate in internships under a master.<br>
